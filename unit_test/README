                   Testing a build of the NCEP BUFRLIB

The run.sh script is currently configured to test the 4_64 and 4_64_DA builds
of NCEP BUFRLIB on the NCEP WCOSS, but it can likely be easily configured to
test builds on other systems as well.

The build to be tested is specified in the script as variable $BUFRLIB.  When
the script is run, numerous test programs are compiled with this build and
then executed, and the output of each program is then automatically compared
against corresponding saved output in the testfiles subdirectory.  All results
are then accumulated, summarized and printed to standard output.
