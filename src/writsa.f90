!> completed message within a memory array.

!> This subroutine is similar to subroutine writsb(), except that in
!> addition to writing each completed message to a specified Fortran
!> logical unit, it also returns a copy of each completed message to
!> the application program within a memory array.

!> <b>Usage:</b> call writsa( LUNXX, LMSGT, MSGT, MSGL )
!>
!> @param[in] LUNXX   -- integer: Absolute value is Fortran logical
!>                       unit number for BUFR file
!> @param[in] LMSGT   -- integer: Dimensioned size (in integers) of
!>                       MSGT; used by the subroutine to ensure that
!>                      it doesn't overflow the MSGT array
!> @param[out] MSGT   -- integer(*): BUFR message
!> @param[out] MSGL   -- integer: Size (in integers) of BUFR message
!>                        in MSGT
!>                        - 0 = No BUFR message was returned within
!>                              MSGT
!> 
!> <p>This subroutine looks and behaves a lot like subroutine writsb().
!> Specifically, it is called to indicate to the BUFRLIB software that
!> all necessary values for a data subset (i.e. report) have been written,
!> and thus that the subset is ready to be encoded and packed into the
!> current message for the BUFR file associated with logical unit
!> ABS(LUNXX).  Logical unit ABS(LUNXX) should have already been opened
!> for output operations via a previous call to subroutine openbf(),
!> and a BUFR message should already be open for output within internal
!> arrays via a previous call to one of the BUFRLIB
!> [message-writing subroutines](@ref hierarchy).
!> Furthermore, all of the values for the data subset should have
!> already been written into internal arrays via calls to any of the
!> BUFRLIB [values-writing subroutines](@ref hierarchy)
!>
!> <p>Where this subroutine differs from writsb() is that, in addition
!> to doing all of the above, it also returns a copy of each completed
!> BUFR message to the application program within a memory array.
!> When using this subroutine, it is important to note that the BUFRLIB
!> software is designed to pack as many data subsets as possible into
!> each message for output, and therefore not every call to this
!> subroutine will result in a message being returned in MSGT. In
!> such cases, MSGL will contain the value 0, indicating that no
!> message was returned.
!>
!> <p>In other words, only when MSGL contains a value
!> greater than 0 is there an actual BUFR message within MSGT; otherwise,
!> the message into which the data subset was packed remains internally
!> within BUFRLIB so that future data subsets can be packed into it as
!> well, and the message will eventually be returned during some other
!> future call to this subroutine. For this reason, there is a way to
!> force the subroutine to return any message contained within the
!> internal BUFRLIB arrays, such as when there are no more data subsets
!> to be encoded and we're ready to exit the application program.  In
!> this case, the application program should make one final call to
!> this subroutine, but with LUNXX set to a negative value;
!> specifically, to the additive inverse of the Fortran logical unit
!> number of the BUFR file.  This signals to the subroutine that there
!> are no more data subsets to be packed into the current message for
!> logical unit ABS(LUNXX), and that the existing message should
!> instead be immediately flushed to output and returned in MSGT.
!>
!> @remarks
!> - There is a maximum size for any BUFR message that can be written
!> by the BUFRLIB software.  This maximum message size is initially set
!> to an internal default value within subroutine bfrini(), but it can
!> be changed to a different value via a separate prior call to
!> subroutine maxout().
!> - As is the case for subroutine writsb(), this subroutine will also
!> check to ensure that the data subset, when encoded and packed, will
!> fit into the current BUFR message that is open within the internal
!> arrays associated with logical unit ABS(LUNXX).  If adding the data
!> subset to the current message would cause the maximum message size
!> to be exceeded, then the subroutine will automatically flush the
!> current message to logical unit ABS(LUNXX) and to array MSGT, then
!> open and initialize a new internal message using the same SUBSET and
!> JDATE values that were specified in the most recent call to one of
!> the [message-writing subroutines](@ref hierarchy) for ABS(LUNXX),
!> then encode and pack the data subset into that new message.
!> - If the user would prefer that output messages only be returned
!> to the calling program via the MSGT memory array and not also
!> written to Fortran logical unit ABS(LUNXX), then this can be
!> accomplished by setting IO = 'NUL' when calling subroutine openbf()
!> for ABS(LUNXX).  In such cases, the logical unit number ABS(LUNXX)
!> does not even need to be associated with an actual file on the
!> local system.
