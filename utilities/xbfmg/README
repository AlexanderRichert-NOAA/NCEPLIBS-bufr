This utility locates and extracts all of the BUFR messages from within a
specified input file, writing each into its own separate output file with
a unique filename.

Example:

	xbfmg [options] <inputfile>

will extract all of the BUFR messages from <inputfile> into the following
filenames:

	xbfmg.out.(pid).000001
	xbfmg.out.(pid).000002
	xbfmg.out.(pid).000003
	.
	.
	xbfmg.out.(pid).(last#)

where:
	(pid) = pid of xbfmg process
	(last#) = total number of BUFR messages in file

and possible options are:

	-v	prints version information and exits
	-g	retains any GTS bulletin information associated with the
		BUFR message in each output file
