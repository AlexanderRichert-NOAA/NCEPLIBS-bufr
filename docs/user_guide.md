This library contains subroutines, functions and other utilities that can be
used to read (decode) and write (encode) data in BUFR, which is a
[WMO](https://public.wmo.int) standard format for the exchange of
meteorological data.

Please see the [Related Pages](pages.html) tab for more details on this library,
including a comprehensive user guide.

The Python API documentation is available
[here](https://noaa-emc.github.io/NCEPLIBS-bufr/python/index.html); however,
note that this functionality is only available if the library was built using
the -DENABLE_PYTHON=ON option during the cmake step.

This library is part of the
[NCEPLIBS](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS) project.
