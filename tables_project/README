This directory contains copies of files used in the NCEP BUFR tables project.

The purpose of the project is to ingest WMO BUFR tables formatted in XML into
a local MySQL database and then export information from that database into
various ASCII formats for use at NCEP.  Exported files include input master
tables formatted for use with the NCEP BUFRLIB software, and HTML for use as
online documentation by EMC and others.

   saved_SQL/ - SQL reference commands used when working with the database
         src/ - Java source code used to ingest tables into the database and
